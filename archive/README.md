# Archive of old analyses

Many of these analyses may still be relevent. They are grouped as follows:

##### n_calculation

Exploratory n-factor mixed models. N-factors were calculated from sites with 100% of the temperature data present.

##### data_plot

Initial visulation of data previous database upload iterations. Includes temperature and calculation n-factors.

##### world_dat

Script written by Mike Loranty for extracting World Clim classifications.

##### AGU_analysis

Scripts for plots developed for the presentation _Vegetation Impacts on Decoupling of Air and Soil Temperatures across the Arctic_ at AGU 2016.

##### Tmod_initial

Scripts for mixed models looking at intial vegetation and geographic variables with initial runs of the temperature model. These scripts were ultimately not well organized analyses, but current analyses may contain portions of them.
