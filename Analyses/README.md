# Soil temperature analyses
This folder contains analyses from parameters derived from the air and soil temperature model. The file *temp_parm_extract.r* organizes all soil temperature output. Analyses are conducted on parameters estimated in the model. In the case of calculated values such as mean annual temperature, these calculations will solely use data if all observations are present. In cases of missing data, model estimated temperature is used when daily data is missing. Analyses incorporate temperature model uncertainty in any model derived estimations using an error model.
